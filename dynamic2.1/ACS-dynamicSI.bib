	abstract = {Reactive absorption processes usually represent kinetically controlled operations in which complex reactions are combined with multicomponent mass transfer. For this reason, an adequate theoretical description of reactive absorption should be based on the rate-based approach, with the direct consideration of the process rates. Along these lines, a rigorous dynamic model allowing for multicomponent two-phase mass transfer, film and bulk reaction mechanisms, thermodynamic nonidealities, fluid dynamics and heat effects is developed. For systems including electrolytes, an additional account of the electrical potential gradient is involved. The whole dynamic rate-based model represents a system of partial differential equations which has to be solved numerically. To validate the model, the reactive absorption of sour gases in an air purification process with packed columns is simulated. Several simulation results including different sensitivity studies are presented. The model is also tested against pilot-plant steady-state experiments. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data.},

	abstract = {Absorption of gases in liquid solutions accompanied by chemical reactions or reactive absorption, represents one of the most important industrial operations. The advantages of this process are enhanced solution capacity, low impurity concentrations up to the ppm-range, moderate operation pressure, and selective removal of contaminants. Reactive absorption is based on a combination of several kinetically controlled phenomena, the focus being on the coupling of chemical reactions and mass transfer in multicomponent mixtures. Therefore, a process description using the equilibrium concept is often insufficient and kinetic modeling is required. This paper describes the basics of rigorous modeling of reactive absorption processes. Several case studies are used in order to validate the models. In addition, a discussion of necessary model parameters, such as diffusion coefficients and reaction kinetics, is given. A reduced model with lower computation time is obtained via detailed sensitivity analysis. This model is successfully used in dynamic simulations. In this respect a proper consideration of the film reactions appears to be crucial.},

	abstract = {Industry experts suggest that effective modeling of reactive absorption enhances system design, improves experimentation, and facilitates operation and control decisions. Modeling and design of reactive absorption are based on the equilibrium stage model which assumes that each stream leaving a tray or a packing segment is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the corresponding liquid stream leaving the same tray or segment. A proper modeling approach is based on the nonreactive equilibrium stage model, which is extended by simultaneously considering the chemical relationship and the stray or stage efficiency. Correlation parameters, such as tray efficiencies or height equivalent to a theoretical stage (HETS) values are introduced to adjust the equilibrium-based theoretical description to real column conditions as thermodynamic equilibrium is unable to be reached in real reactive absorption processes.},

	abstract = {A unified modeling approach that combines the rigorous non-equilibrium (NEQ) rate-based balance equations with the model-order reduction properties of orthogonal collocation on finite elements (OCFE) approximation techniques is employed for the optimal design, operation optimization and dynamic simulation of complex staged reactive separation processes. The NEQ/OCFE process model formulation involves the rigorous description of mass and heat transfer phenomena, phase equilibrium relations and chemical reactions in both gas and liquid phases in a limited but sufficient for an accurate representation of the column behavior, number of collocation points. In addition, polynomial approximation as implemented in the OCFE techniques, transforms the staged column domain into a continuous analog. Hence, a significant degree of modeling detail is maintained, while a more compact model formulation than the equivalent full-order (tray-by-tray) model is used. The NEQ/OCFE modeling framework has been proved particularly efficient in the optimal design of reactive absorption and distillation columns especially those with multiple side feed and product streams mainly due to the elimination of binary decision variables associated with the existence of column stages in any given column section. Furthermore, the compact model size and the demonstrated ability of the OCFE approximation to accurately identify the optimal solution and reveal the dynamic characteristics of complex reactive separation columns make the proposed modeling framework particularly attractive for real-time optimization and control applications. Distinctive process examples such as the reactive absorption of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from a gas stream by a weak HNO3 aqueous solution in the industrial production of nitric acid, as well as the production of ethyl acetate by reactive distillation clearly demonstrate the merits and strengths of the NEQ/OCFE modeling framework.},

@article{Nasri2012,
	abstract = {In the present paper, Mathematica{\textregistered}, the famous computer algebra, is used to perform steady-state and dynamic simulations of a multi-component distillation column. In order to describe the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) relationships and to compute the vapor- and liquid-phase enthalpies, the Soave- Redlich-Kwong equation of state (SRK EOS) is chosen. Rigorous modeling is performed where both mass and energy balance equations are solved. The Francis weir formula is selected to model column hydraulics. All steady-state results of the column simulations are found to agree very well with those obtained using HYSYS. Finally, some insight into column control is given through the application of both the slope and sensitivity criteria. The computer code, developed at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology (INSAT) in Tunis by the authors, has served to teach several aspects of chemical engineering to senior undergraduate students at INSAT. Indeed, students gain from such code a good understanding of energy and mass balances, column dynamic and control, equations of state and VLE as well as some applied mathematics such as nonlinear algebraic equations, differential-algebraic systems of equations, and how they can be solved using computer algebra such as Mathematica{\textregistered}. In addition, they learn about major process simulators such as HYSYS. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ 20: 193-202, 2012 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {After applying the Finite Element Method (FEM) to the diffusion-type and wave-type Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), a first order and a second order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems are obtained respectively. These ODE systems usually present high stiffness, so numerical methods with good stability properties are required in their resolution. MATLAB offers a set of open source adaptive step functions for solving ODEs. One of these functions is the ode15s recommended to solve stiff problems and which is based on the Backward Differentiation Formulae (BDF). We describe the error estimation and the step size control implemented in this function. The ode15s is a variable order algorithm, and even though it has an adaptive step size implementation, the advancing formula and the local error estimation that uses correspond to the constant step size formula. We have focused on the second order accurate and unconditionally stable BDF (BDF2) and we have implemented a real adaptive step size BDF2 algorithm using the same strategy as the BDF2 implemented in the ode15s, resulting the new algorithm more efficient than the one implemented in MATLAB. {\textcopyright} The Authors.
